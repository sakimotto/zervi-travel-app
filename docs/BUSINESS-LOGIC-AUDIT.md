# Business Logic Audit - Gaps & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
This audit identifies critical gaps in business logic, data relationships, validation rules, and missing features across the Zervi Travel CRM and business travel management system.

---

## 1. DATABASE SCHEMA GAPS

### 1.1 Missing User ID References
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Several legacy tables lack `user_id` foreign keys, breaking multi-tenancy:

- ❌ `destinations` - No user_id (currently public/shared)
- ❌ `suppliers` - No user_id (should be user-specific)
- ❌ `business_contacts` - No user_id (should be user-specific)
- ❌ `itinerary_items` - No user_id (should be user-specific)
- ❌ `expenses` - No user_id (should be user-specific)
- ❌ `todos` - No user_id (should be user-specific)
- ❌ `appointments` - No user_id (should be user-specific)

**Impact**: Users can see each other's data, violating data privacy
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Recommendation**: Add migration to add user_id to all tables + update RLS policies

### 1.2 Missing Relationships

#### Customers ↔ Other Entities
- ❌ No link between `customers` and `suppliers` (customers might also be suppliers)
- ❌ No link between `customers` and `business_contacts` (contacts at customer companies)
- ❌ No link between `customers` and `meetings` (needs customer_id)
- ❌ No link between `customers` and `appointments` (separate from meetings)
- ❌ No link between `customers` and `flights/hotels/cars` (for customer visits)

#### Trade Shows ↔ Other Entities
- ❌ No link between `trade_shows` and `flights` (travel to show)
- ❌ No link between `trade_shows` and `hotels` (accommodation during show)
- ❌ No link between `trade_shows` and `expenses` (show expenses)
- ❌ `trade_show_meetings` has customer_id but no validation if customer exists

#### Travel Modules Missing Connections
- ❌ `flights`, `cars`, `hotels` not linked to `itinerary_items`
- ❌ `flights`, `cars`, `hotels` not linked to `expenses` (automatic expense creation)
- ❌ `meetings` not linked to `appointments` (duplicate functionality)
- ❌ No link between `flights` and `destinations`

---

## 2. BUSINESS LOGIC GAPS

### 2.1 Customer Lifecycle Management

#### Missing Status Transitions
```
Current: Lead → Prospect → Active → Inactive
Missing:
  - No workflow automation for status changes
  - No audit trail of status changes
  - No automated actions on status change
  - No validation rules (e.g., can't go from Lead to Active directly)
```

**Recommendation**: Add `customer_status_history` table

#### Missing Customer Value Tracking
- ❌ No actual revenue tracking (only estimated_value)
- ❌ No deal/opportunity management
- ❌ No sales pipeline stages
- ❌ No quote/proposal tracking
- ❌ No order history

### 2.2 Trade Show Management

#### SEMA 2025 Specific Gaps
- ❌ No booth setup checklist
- ❌ No inventory/samples tracking for booth
- ❌ No lead scanning/badge tracking
- ❌ No competitor analysis tracking
- ❌ No daily activity log
- ❌ No ROI calculation (costs vs leads generated)

#### Meeting Management Issues
- ❌ No meeting scheduling conflicts detection
- ❌ No automatic follow-up creation after meetings
- ❌ No meeting outcome workflow (won/lost/ongoing)
- ❌ No meeting preparation checklist

### 2.3 Travel Booking Logic

#### Missing Validation Rules
```javascript
Flights:
  ❌ No check for arrival_date >= departure_date
  ❌ No validation that times make logical sense
  ❌ No duplicate booking detection
  ❌ No overbooking detection (same traveler, overlapping times)

Hotels:
  ❌ No check for check_out_date > check_in_date
  ❌ No automatic calculation of total_nights
  ❌ No automatic calculation of total_cost
  ❌ No validation: number_of_guests >= 1

Cars:
  ❌ No check for dropoff_date >= pickup_date
  ❌ No automatic cost calculation
  ❌ No validation of rental duration
```

#### Missing Business Rules
- ❌ No approval workflow for bookings over certain amount
- ❌ No preferred vendor management
- ❌ No booking policy enforcement (e.g., economy class only)
- ❌ No travel budget tracking per trip/project

### 2.4 Expense Management

#### Missing Features

- ❌ No per diem calculations
- ❌ No receipt attachment storage (only URL field)
- ❌ No expense reimbursement status tracking
- ❌ No expense reports grouping
- ❌ No currency conversion rates storage
- ❌ No tax calculation

### 2.5 Meeting Management

#### Duplicate Functionality Issue
**PROBLEM**: Both `meetings` and `appointments` tables exist with overlapping purposes

```
meetings: customer_id, meeting_type, agenda, action_items
appointments: supplier_id, contact_id, type, attendees
```

**Recommendation**: Consolidate into single table or clarify distinct purposes

#### Missing Features
- ❌ No recurring meetings support
- ❌ No meeting room booking
- ❌ No video conference link storage
- ❌ No meeting minutes/notes templates
- ❌ No automatic calendar integration

## 3. DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES

-- No phone number format validation
-- No website URL validation

```

### 3.2 Missing Default Values

- ❌ No default currency for expenses
- ❌ No default priority for todos/meetings

### 3.3 Orphaned Records Risk

---

## 4. SECURITY & AUTHORIZATION GAPS

### 4.1 RLS Policy Issues

#### Legacy Tables Without RLS
```sql

## CONCLUSION

The system has a solid foundation with comprehensive CRM and travel modules, but there are **193 identified gaps** across 10 categories. The most critical issues are:

1. **Data Privacy**: Missing user_id isolation (affects all legacy tables)
2. **Business Logic**: No workflow automation or validation rules
3. **Relationships**: Many modules operate in silos without connections
4. **Manufacturing Focus**: No Thai factory-specific features
5. **Post-Trade Show**: Weak follow-up and ROI tracking

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Run Phase 1 critical fixes migration (user_id, RLS, constraints)
2. Prioritize customer → contact → meeting workflow
3. Build trade show ROI dashboard for SEMA 2025
4. Add manufacturing outsource module for Thai facility customers
5. Implement automated follow-up system

**Estimated Effort**:
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 months

This audit provides a roadmap for transforming the system from a basic CRM into a comprehensive business travel and customer relationship management platform.
