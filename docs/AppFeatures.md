**Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite  

This document outlines the key features and implementation details of Zervi Travel that make it a comprehensive business travel management solution.

## Core Features

### 1. Data Persistence
- **Supabase Backend**: All user data persists to PostgreSQL database with real-time sync
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: User data isolation and secure multi-tenant architecture
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password and social login support
- **Offline Fallback**: Sample data available when offline with localStorage backup
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based data portability for backup, sharing, and migration

### 2. UI Components
- **Modal System**: Reusable modal pattern for adding/editing data
- **Card Components**: Flexible card layout for displaying data items
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Search & Filter**: Combined text search and category filtering
- **Toggle Views**: Switch between detailed and summary views of data

### 3. Data Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Validation**: Form validation for user inputs
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data entities
- **Sample Data**: Realistic placeholder data with reset capability

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Print Functionality**: Generate printer-friendly versions of data
- **Data Visualization**: Visually distinguish between different data types
- **Confirmation Flows**: Multi-step processes for destructive operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallbacks

## Implementation Details

### Supabase Integration Pattern
The Supabase implementation follows enterprise-grade patterns:
- Custom React hooks for each data entity (useDestinations, useSuppliers, etc.)
- Real-time CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic retry logic for network failures
- Type-safe database operations with TypeScript

### Modal Architecture
Modals follow a consistent pattern:
- Controlled by parent component state
- Props for `onClose` and `onSave` callbacks
- Optional `editItem` prop for editing existing data
- Form state management within the modal
- Consistent styling and keyboard navigation

### Data Flow
1. Initial app load authenticates user and fetches from Supabase
2. If database is empty, sample data is automatically seeded
3. All CRUD operations immediately sync to PostgreSQL backend
4. Real-time subscriptions keep data current across browser tabs
5. Offline mode gracefully degrades to sample data with sync on reconnection

### File Organization
- **Components/**: UI components organized by feature
- **Data/**: Sample data organized by entity type
- **Types/**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Utils/**: Helper functions for data operations and UI interactions

## Adaptability Strengths

This application template excels at being adapted for projects that need:

1. **Offline-First Functionality**: Works without internet connection
2. **Personal Data Management**: User-owned data that doesn't require a backend
3. **Quick Prototyping**: Rapidly deploy MVPs without backend infrastructure
4. **Multi-Device Usage**: Access consistent data across devices
5. **Form-Heavy Applications**: Complex data entry with validation
6. **List/Detail Views**: Browse collections of data with detailed views
